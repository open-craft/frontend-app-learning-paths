Purpose
=======

The Learning Paths MFE provides a specialized frontend interface for managing and displaying
learning paths in Open edX. Learning paths are curated sequences of courses that guide learners
through a structured educational journey toward mastering specific skills or knowledge areas.

This MFE serves as the frontend for the learning-paths-plugin_, which provides the complete backend functionality.

.. _learning-paths-plugin: https://github.com/open-craft/learning-paths-plugin/

Getting Started
===============

Tutor Setup
-----------

Follow these steps to set up the Learning Paths MFE with Tutor:

#. Navigate to your Tutor plugins directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd "$(tutor plugins printroot)"

#. Create a file named ``learning_paths.py`` with the following content:

   .. code-block:: python

      from tutormfe.hooks import MFE_APPS

      @MFE_APPS.add()
      def _add_learning_paths_mfe(mfes):
          mfes["learning-paths"] = {
              "repository": "https://github.com/open-craft/frontend-app-learning-paths.git",
              "port": 2100,
              "version": "main",  # optional, will default to the Open edX current tag
          }
          return mfes

#. Enable the plugin:

   .. code-block:: bash

      tutor plugins enable learning_paths

#. Build the MFE image:

   .. code-block:: bash

      tutor images build mfe

#. Restart the MFE container to apply changes:

   .. code-block:: bash

      tutor dev stop mfe && tutor dev start -d

#. Access the Learning Paths MFE at: http://apps.local.openedx.io:2100/learning-paths/

Development Setup
-----------------

After completing the Tutor setup, prepare the repository for local development:

#. Clone this repository:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/open-craft/frontend-app-learning-paths.git
      cd frontend-app-learning-paths

#. Create `.env.private` with the following content:

   .. code-block:: bash

      LMS_BASE_URL='http://local.openedx.io:8000'
      LOGIN_URL='http://local.openedx.io:8000/login'
      LOGOUT_URL='http://local.openedx.io:8000/logout'
      REFRESH_ACCESS_TOKEN_ENDPOINT='http://local.openedx.io:8000/login_refresh'
      TERMS_OF_SERVICE_URL='https://www.edx.org/edx-terms-service'
      PRIVACY_POLICY_URL='http://local.openedx.io:8000/privacy'

#. Install dependencies:

   .. code-block:: bash

      npm install

#. Mount the repository for development:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd ..
      tutor mounts add $(pwd)/frontend-app-learning-paths

#. Restart the MFE container (to unbind the port) and start the MFEs:

   .. code-block:: bash

      tutor dev stop mfe && tutor dev start -d

#. Make changes to the code and see them reflected in real-time.

Local Development
-----------------

You can also run this MFE locally without mounting it in Tutor:

#. First, create a Tutor plugin to add CORS configuration:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd "$(tutor plugins printroot)"

#. Create a file named ``learning_paths.py`` with the following content:

   .. code-block:: python

      from tutor import hooks

      hooks.Filters.ENV_PATCHES.add_item(
          (
              "openedx-lms-common-settings",
              'CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST.append("http://apps.local.openedx.io:2100")'
          )
      )

#. Enable the plugin:

   .. code-block:: bash

      tutor plugins enable learning_paths

#. Run the MFE locally:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd frontend-app-learning-paths
      npm install
      npm start --local
